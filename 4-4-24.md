# Design notes

## Snake movement

- Head entity
  - Components: Head, appearance, position, movement, input, collisiom
- Segment entity
  - Components: segment, appearance, position, movement, collision, turnpoints
- Tail entity
  - Components: tail appearance position movement collision turn points
    This is all ecs tho^ so not sure how that corresponds

So the body parts follow the same line that the head is going through.

## Turn points

- All of the segments that follow the snake will follow the path
- we need to keep track of these turn points and as a segment hits a turn point it will start going to the other one.

- each snake segment has a turnpoints component

  - a FIFO Queue of turn points

- movement system
  - moves each segment towards the turn point at the front of the queue
  - When that point is hit, pull it off the front of the queue
    - Need to test with tolerance because segment won't hit it exactly
    - Might also need to split the update into two parts
      - Move until segment hits turn point (if it hits the turn point)
      - Then move for the remaining time towards the next turn point

mouse can give us a turn a frame

- Send the last mouse movement to the server not everysingle one?
- Require that the head move at least a segment before it sends something? IDK
- note that the segments follow exactly

Client vs server

- server

  - has a movement system that moves tha snake
  - Recieves inputs from the client
  - upon a valid turn adds a anew turn point to all snake segments, infroms - client of this turn
  - performs collision detection
    - upon detection: informs clients, removes that snake entites, adds new food enttites

- client
  - has a movement system that moves the snake
  - Send inputs to the server
  - Upon receipt of a new turn point, adds it to all of the snake segments
  - Does not predict collision, doesn't do anything
  - Upon collision message from server, creates particle effects as needed

lets talk mouse
if we're only sending the last position of the mouse to the server
in the client in its update, it throws away all of them except the last one.

K WE'RE NOT DOING MOUSE YIPEEE
wasd but diaganols have to work.

We still need customizable controls. (werid)

client is just sending cardinal direction btw
