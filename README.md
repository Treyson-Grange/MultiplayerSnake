# Introduction

Welcome to our SnakeJS, developed as part of our CS5410 Game Development class. With JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and Node.js as our tools, our team of three set out to create a modern rendition of this beloved classic.
## Installation

To get started, simply clone this repository and install the dependencies using npm:

```
git clone https://github.com/Treyson-Grange/SnakeJS.git
cd SnakeJS
npm install
```


## Usage

Once the installation is complete, you can start the server by running: `npm start`

Head to [localhost:3000](localhost:3000) to play. Open multiple windows on localhost to simulate multiple players. 

NOTE: It is possible to do local play here, but it differs based on many variables, so it is not documneted here. Feel free to mess around with it as need be.
